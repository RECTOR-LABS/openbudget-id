## Hackathon Subthemes

### 📰 Anti-Hoax & Trusted Info

Disinformation is spreading—ranging from health hoaxes to political manipulation. Blockchain can provide a tamper-resistant source-of-truth: news source trails, digital content certificates, and author verification. With privacy-preserving and decentralized technology, the public can place greater trust in the information they consume.

**Guiding questions:**

- How can we verify information accuracy without sacrificing user privacy?
- Can blockchain give a "genuine" label to digital content?
- How to design user-friendly verification systems for the general public?

---

### 🏛 Civic Tech & Governance

Public trust in digital governance is often fragile. Blockchain-based civic tech could enable transparent yet private digital voting, anonymous yet validated citizen reporting, and public budget dashboards accessible to everyone.

**Guiding questions:**

- How can we design verifiable yet secret digital voting?
- How can blockchain improve transparency in public fund usage?
- Can citizens report social issues anonymously yet remain verified?

---

### 💸 Inclusive Economy

MSMEs, creative workers, and vulnerable communities are often left behind in the digital economy. Blockchain opens new opportunities: digital cooperatives powered by smart contracts, transparent savings-and-loan systems, or near-zero-cost micro-payments across regions.

**Guiding questions:**

- How can blockchain make digital cooperatives more transparent and fair?
- How to design cheap yet secure micro-payments?
- Can smart contracts protect creative workers from exploitation?

---

### 🆔 Safe Digital Identity

Digital identity is the gateway to public services, but also a vulnerable point for leaks. With technologies like Zero-Knowledge Proofs, people can prove status or attributes without disclosing all personal data.

**Guiding questions:**

- How to prove attributes (age, status) without exposing full identity data?
- What digital ID models are both secure and interoperable?
- Can digital IDs protect citizens from mass data theft?

---

### 🌱 Green Tech & Sustainability

Blockchain is often criticized for being energy-intensive, but new innovations make it a green tech tool. With energy-efficient infrastructure, it can be used to track carbon footprints, incentivize recycling, or record carbon trading transparently.

**Guiding questions:**

- How can blockchain transparently track carbon footprints?
- What incentive mechanisms effectively drive green action in society?
- How to ensure blockchain solutions are truly eco-friendly?

---

### 🧒 Child Safety Online

The internet offers children space to learn and play but also brings risks: exploitation, harmful content, and data theft. Blockchain could help: encrypted child identities, safe age verification, and trusted anonymous reporting channels.

**Guiding questions:**

- How to create child digital identities that are safe yet inclusive?
- Can blockchain permanently block harmful content distribution?
- How to design safe online reporting systems for children and parents?

- **Link to MVP / Project Website:** A direct, public link to your working Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This can be a live website or a web application.
- **Link to Demo Video:** A short video (maximum 3 minutes) demonstrating your MVP's core features and functionality. This is the primary way you will prove your MVP works.
- **Link to Project GitHub:** A public link to your code repository.
- **Link to Presentation:** A link to your pitch deck (e.g., Google Slides, PDF) outlining your project's impact, feasibility, and alignment with the hackathon's themes.
- **Mandatory Submission to Colosseum Cyberpunk:** Any of the submitters MUST submit their project to Colosseum Cyberpunk as part of the official process.

### 2. Eligibility Criteria

To be eligible for judging and to compete for the prize pool, all teams must meet the following criteria:
