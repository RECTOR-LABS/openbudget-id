## Project Overview

**OpenBudget.ID** - 🥈 **2nd Place Winner** at Garuda Spark Hackathon (Oct 2025) - **1,500 USDC Prize**

Blockchain transparency platform enabling Indonesian ministries to record spending milestones immutably on Solana, allowing citizens to verify in real-time.

- **Achievement:** 2nd Place, Garuda Spark - Blockchain for Good (Superteam Indonesia × Komdigi × Ekraf)
- **Stack:** Solana Agave 3.0.7 (Rust 1.90.0/Anchor 0.32.1) + Next.js 14 + PostgreSQL
- **Key Principle:** Blockchain as invisible infrastructure, not interface

## Architecture

**Hybrid Pattern:**
- **On-Chain (Solana):** Immutable spending records (source of truth)
- **Off-Chain (PostgreSQL):** Searchable metadata, user accounts
- **Bridge (Next.js API):** Coordinates DB ↔ Blockchain

**Critical Workflow:**
```
Ministry Action → DB (draft) → Blockchain (publish) → DB (update with tx refs)
```

**Why Hybrid?**
- Blockchain queries slow/expensive → use DB for browsing
- DB can be tampered → blockchain for verification
- Citizens get fast UX + trustless verification

## Blockchain as Single Source of Truth

**Core Architectural Principle:**

```
Blockchain (Solana) = Single Source of Truth (Immutable, Authoritative)
         ↓
Database (PostgreSQL) = Cache/Index (Fast queries, Disposable, Rebuildable)
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- ✅ **Blockchain is ALWAYS the valid source** - Immutable, tamper-proof, authoritative
- ✅ **Database is just a cache** - Optimized for fast queries and search
- ✅ **Database can drift out of sync** - Network issues, Fast Refresh, bugs can cause inconsistency
- ✅ **When conflicts detected** - Query blockchain and heal database automatically
- ✅ **Database is expendable** - Can be deleted and rebuilt from blockchain at any time

**Implemented Self-Healing Features:**

1. **Automatic Recovery on Release Errors:**
   - When "MilestoneAlreadyReleased" error occurs during release
   - System queries blockchain to verify actual state
   - Fetches transaction history from milestone PDA
   - Finds ReleaseFunds transaction by parsing logs
   - Extracts real transaction signature
   - Updates database automatically with correct data
   - Shows success message and refreshes UI
   - **Result:** 100% automatic, no manual intervention needed

2. **Manual Verify Button (🔍 Verify):**
   - Queries blockchain for milestone release status
   - Compares with database state
   - Visual indicator: ✓ Synced (green) | ⚠ Out of Sync (red)
   - Available for every milestone
   - Instant verification without side effects

3. **Manual Sync Button (🔄 Sync):**
   - Appears when verification shows out-of-sync
   - Queries blockchain for actual state
   - Finds release transaction if milestone is released on-chain
   - Updates database to match blockchain
   - Confirms sync with success message
   - **Use case:** Manual recovery when self-healing didn't trigger

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Works in development (with Fast Refresh interruptions)
- ✅ Works in production (with network glitches or database failures)
- ✅ Citizens ALWAYS see accurate data (blockchain = truth)
- ✅ Graceful degradation (database failure doesn't break app)
- ✅ Auditable and transparent (blockchain records are permanent)
- ✅ Production-ready for hackathon demo (no manual SQL needed)

**Future Enhancements:**
- **Background Sync Job:** Periodically verify all projects against blockchain
- **Automatic Verification on Page Load:** Check database matches blockchain on mount
- **Full Project Rebuild:** Button to rebuild entire project state from blockchain
- **Blockchain Explorer Integration:** Direct links to verify every transaction

**Demo Talking Points:**
> "Our system uses Solana blockchain as the single source of truth. The database is just a cache for fast queries. If data ever conflicts, we automatically query the blockchain and heal the database. This ensures citizens ALWAYS see accurate, immutable spending records. The database can fail, be corrupted, or deleted - we can always rebuild it from blockchain."

## Data Flows

**Project Publishing:**
1. Ministry login (Google OAuth) → Create project (draft in DB)
2. Connect wallet → Publish to blockchain (`initialize_project()` instruction)
3. Get tx signature → Update DB with `solana_account` + `creation_tx`, status = `published`

**Milestone Release:**
1. Ministry uploads proof → Signs `release_funds()` transaction
2. On-chain Milestone updated (`is_released = true`)
3. DB updated with `release_tx` + `released_at`

**Citizen Verification:**
1. Browse projects (DB query) → Click project detail → See milestones with tx hashes
2. Click "View on Solana Explorer" → Verify on-chain matches displayed data

**Citizen Engagement (Epic 6):**
1. **Comments:** View project → Submit comment (rate limited: 5/24h) → Stored in DB → Ministry can respond
2. **Trust Score:** View project → Rate 1-5 stars + optional comment → Upsert to DB → Materialized view refreshed
3. **Watchlist:** View project → Subscribe with frequency → Stored in DB → Email notifications (TODO: Resend integration)
4. **Issue Reporting:** View project → Report suspicious spending → Stored in DB with severity → Ministry notified (TODO)

**Analytics & Intelligence (Epic 7):**
1. **Leaderboard:** Admin visits /analytics → Query materialized view → Display ranked ministries
2. **Trends:** Admin selects date range → API groups by period → Recharts visualizes spending over time
3. **Anomalies:** Background detection runs → 4 pattern checks → Flag suspicious projects → Display on dashboard
4. **Materialized View Refresh:** Rating submitted → refresh_ministry_performance() → Stats updated → Available for next query

## Critical Configuration

**Program ID Synchronization (✅ SYNCED IN ALL 3 PLACES):**
1. `solana-program/openbudget/Anchor.toml` → `[programs.devnet]` = `RECtBgp43nvj5inPVW7qo1YN95RwXaYDxLX4dvuJXFY`
2. `solana-program/openbudget/programs/openbudget/src/lib.rs` → `declare_id!("RECtBgp43nvj5inPVW7qo1YN95RwXaYDxLX4dvuJXFY")`
3. `frontend/.env.local` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_PROGRAM_ID=RECtBgp43nvj5inPVW7qo1YN95RwXaYDxLX4dvuJXFY`

**Explorer Link:** https://explorer.solana.com/address/RECtBgp43nvj5inPVW7qo1YN95RwXaYDxLX4dvuJXFY?cluster=devnet

**PDA Seeds Must Match:**
```rust
// Rust: seeds = [b"project", id.as_bytes()]
// TypeScript: PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync([Buffer.from('project'), Buffer.from(id)], programId)
```
**Mismatch = account not found errors!**

## Environment Variables

**frontend/.env.local:**
```env
# Database (✅ Configured)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://rz@localhost:5432/openbudget

# Solana (✅ Configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_PROGRAM_ID=RECtBgp43nvj5inPVW7qo1YN95RwXaYDxLX4dvuJXFY
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet

# NextAuth (⏳ To be configured in Epic 3)
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here-change-in-production

# Google OAuth (⏳ To be configured in Epic 3)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```

**Google OAuth redirect URI:** `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`

## Anchor Program Structure

**✅ Implemented Instructions:**
1. ✅ `initialize_platform` - Sets up global platform state
2. ✅ `initialize_project(project_id, title, ministry, total_budget)` - Creates budget project
3. ✅ `add_milestone(project_id, index, description, amount)` - Adds milestone with budget validation
4. ✅ `release_funds(project_id, index, proof_url)` - Releases funds (one-way operation)

**Account Structures (in `state.rs`):**
- `PlatformState` (48 bytes): admin, project_count
- `Project` (267 bytes): id, title, ministry, total_budget, **total_allocated**, **total_released**, milestone_count, created_at, authority
  - **Key Design:** `total_allocated` tracks milestone budget commitments, `total_released` tracks actual releases
  - This separation prevents over-allocation while allowing milestones to be planned before release
- `Milestone` (471 bytes): project_id, index, description, amount, is_released, released_at, proof_url

**Error Codes:** ProjectIdTooLong, InvalidTitle, InvalidBudget, InsufficientBudget, UnauthorizedAccess, MilestoneAlreadyReleased

**Test Coverage:** 14/14 tests passing (platform init, project creation with validation, milestone management, authority checks)

  - Returns project details with anomaly descriptions

**Utilities:**
- `frontend/lib/db.ts` - PostgreSQL connection pool with transaction support
- `frontend/lib/solana.ts` - PDA helpers, explorer URLs, connection management

## Performance

**Critical:** ❌ NEVER query Solana for every request (slow, expensive RPC)
- ✅ Use PostgreSQL for browsing/filtering
- ✅ Use Solana only for verification links
- Public devnet RPC has rate limits → production needs dedicated RPC (Helius/QuickNode)

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Program ID mismatch:** Run `anchor keys list`, update 3 locations, rebuild
2. **Wallet connection fails:** Check `<WalletProvider>` wraps app, wallet on devnet
3. **PDA account not found:** Verify seeds match exactly (Rust vs TypeScript)
4. **DB connection error:** Check `.env.local` has `DATABASE_URL`, PostgreSQL running
5. **NextAuth error:** Generate `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` with `openssl rand -base64 32`

   - Project creation and blockchain publishing
   - Milestone release functionality

**Environment Variables Location:**
- VPS: `/home/openbudget/openbudget-garuda-spark/frontend/.kamal/secrets`
- Contains all production secrets (DATABASE_URL, API keys, etc.)

**Troubleshooting:**

1. **Container won't start:**
   ```bash
   ssh openbudget "docker logs openbudget-web"
   # Check for missing environment variables or build errors
   ```

2. **Database connection errors:**
   ```bash
   # Verify DATABASE_URL in .kamal/secrets
   ssh openbudget "cat openbudget-garuda-spark/frontend/.kamal/secrets | grep DATABASE_URL"

   # Test PostgreSQL connection
   ssh openbudget "psql <DATABASE_URL> -c 'SELECT 1'"
   ```

3. **Port conflicts:**
   ```bash
   # Check what's using port 3100
   ssh openbudget "lsof -i :3100"

   # Stop conflicting service or change port mapping
   ```

4. **Build errors during deployment:**
   ```bash
   # SSH into VPS and build manually to see full logs
   ssh openbudget
   cd openbudget-garuda-spark/frontend
   docker build -t openbudget:latest .
   ```

**Performance Notes:**
- Docker build time: ~50-60 seconds
- Container startup: ~5 seconds
- Static page generation warnings during build are expected (database not accessible during build)
- First request after deployment may take 2-3 seconds (cold start)

## Hackathon Context

**🏆 RESULT: 2nd Place - 1,500 USDC Prize**

**Hackathon:** Garuda Spark - Blockchain for Good (October 2025)
**Organizers:** Superteam Indonesia × Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs × Ministry of Creative Economy
**Duration:** 4-day sprint

**What We Delivered:**
- ✅ Full-stack Solana + Next.js transparency platform
- ✅ Devnet deployment with sample projects
- ✅ Public dashboard (no login) + Admin dashboard (Google OAuth)
- ✅ Verifiable transactions on Solana Explorer
- ✅ Citizen engagement (comments, ratings, watchlist, issue reporting)
- ✅ Analytics dashboard (leaderboard, trends, anomaly detection)

**Demo Scenario:**
1. Login → Create project → Publish to blockchain → Show tx hash
2. Public dashboard → Verify project appears → Release milestone
3. Click "Verify on Solana Explorer" → Prove immutability

**Judging Focus:** Social impact (transparency), Solana integration, UX (no crypto jargon), feasibility

**MVP Limitations:**
- No actual fund transfer (symbolic records only)
- Proof documents = URLs (not IPFS)
- No role-based access control
- Mixed Indonesian/English (public UI in Indonesian)
